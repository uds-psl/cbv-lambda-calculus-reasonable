This repository contains the Coq formalisation corresponding to the POPL 2020 paper [The Weak Call-By-Value λ-Calculus is Reasonable for Both Time and Space](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/Publications/details/ForsterKunzeRoth:2019:wcbv-Reasonable.html).  


## How to compile the code

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/uds-psl/cbv-lambda-calculus-reasonable.git
cd cbv-lambda-calculus-reasonable
make
```

The files are tested to compile with `The Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.8.2 (February 2019)`.

The formalized definitions and proofs in the PDF are hyperlinked to the HTML version of the files, which can be found [here](https://uds-psl.github.io/cbv-lambda-calculus-reasonable/website/toc.html) or in the `docs/website` subdirectory of this repository.
